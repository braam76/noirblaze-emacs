## Important

#### This theme is ported from *[noirblaze-vim](https://github.com/n1ghtmare/noirblaze-vim)* made by [Dimitar Dimitrov](https://github.com/n1ghtmare)

---

A dark minimal theme with touch of hot pink.

## Installation

For now it is only available to install manually,
by cloning the repository and adding it to your Emacs config.

```elisp
;; Assumes than you already have themes folder under .emacs.d,
;; but you can use any path you want.

(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/themes/"))
(load-theme 'noirblaze t)
```

Worth to mention, than theme is oprtimized for basic language modes. In future I will improve theme for all modes and situations.
